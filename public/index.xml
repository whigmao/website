      <description>1. Database System Good decisions require good information derived from raw facts. Users can manage data efficiently when it is stored in database in term of size, security, accuracy, ease of updating and redundance.
Databases are shared, integrated computer structure that stores a collection of data.
 End-user data: raw facts of interest to the end user
 Metadata: data about data, description of data characteristics and relationships in data</description>

      <description>The Markets for the Factors of Production The economy’s income is distributed in the markets for the factors of production. The three most important factors of production are labor, land, and capital.
The demand for factors, such as labor, is a derived demand that comes from firms that use the factors to produce goods and services. Competitive, profitmaximizing firms hire each factor up to the point at which the value of the factor’s marginal product equals its price.</description>

      <description>Consumer Choice A consumer’s budget constraint shows the possible combinations of different goods she can buy given her income and the prices of the goods. The slope of the budget constraint equals the relative price of the goods.
The consumer’s indifference curves represent her preferences. An indifference curve shows the various bundles of goods that make the consumer equally happy. Points on higher indifference curves are preferred to points on lower indifference curves.</description>

      <description>从对自己留学这一既成事实后悔以来，我便一直好奇自己和家人为何当初做出了如此不理性的决定，又能够通过何种方式避免重蹈覆辙。后来在神兽之间的推荐下，我开始阅读《清醒思考的艺术》一书。
这篇文章既包含了书中的主要内容，也包含了我对本书中概念的进一步阐释和内容的理解。
首先是对‘理性’一词的理解，作者在书的序言部分写到：思维错误是指系统性地偏离了理性的，合乎逻辑的思考和行为。不过这话说了等于没说，何谓‘理性’？何谓‘合乎逻辑’？作者并未进一步探讨这些概念。但这是不能令读者满足的，所以我打算给‘理性’一个专属于本文的定义：没有从可靠的信息源获得信息或者获得可靠信息后，没有用科学的方法做出推断或者有了可靠信息与科学推断之后，没能做出有效的行动；如果要阐述清楚何谓可靠，科学和有效，这文章可就写不完了，接下来的内容会告诉你那些不算可靠，科学和有效。在此我假定了一个人做出决定的过程为：获得信息，做出判断，采取行动。在每一部分人都有可能会犯错，但某些错误是系统性的，即经常且普遍的。所以作者本人认为值得加以整理并公布，也是我愿意花时间读的原因。
不可靠的信息 1. 幸存偏误 幸存偏误显然是信息被高度扭曲。做决策的人们采信了不可靠的信息源，比如商家的宣传，娱乐媒体的头条和成功人士的演讲。幸存偏误扭曲了真实的成功率，让无数愣头青在偏听偏信之后贸然入场，然后是尸横遍野。
解决办法：永远要问失败率，而不是成功率。
 2. 确认偏误 我们过滤掉与我们的现有观点相矛盾（因此被称作反驳证据，不过它缺少合适的德语表达）的新信息。信息不是被扭曲了而是被无意过滤了。
解决办法：记录自己的所学所思所想，然后反驳自己
 3. 权威偏误 权威的出现使得信息被扭曲，我们会不自觉地认为那些位高权重，腰缠万贯，名满天下的人在各个方面都有着更好的判断。事实并非如此。而在中国，权威偏误还体现在家长权威对信息的扭曲，特别是在未成年人做出重要选择的时候，家长们会把自己几十年前的认知带到现在来，以此指导小孩的人生。结果自然是大家受苦。别听父母亲人的，绝对不是情绪化的宣泄。而是让自己选择更加明智的有效武器。
解决办法：永远去找另一条相反的看法
 4. 现成偏误 又是信息被扭曲的例子，人们对易获取的，现成的，重复出现的信息会高估其真实比例。
解决办法：看看截然不同的想法
 5. 故事偏误 人的大脑喜欢故事，但是故事是对现实的扭曲和简化。
解决办法：学会科学研究
 6. 禀赋效应 我们拥有的东西会被我们不恰当的高估。信息扭曲的案例。比如中文系的人会说中文博大精深，买了房的人会坚信房价会涨。
解决办法：看相反意见
 7. 团体迷思 这难道不是现成偏误的一个例子吗？
 8. 基本特征谬误 即人总是高估人的作用，而忽视了人所处的情景。有意思。会不会政府的作用也被高估了？
解决办法：多关注情景，少关注人。
 9. 自我选择偏误 放大了自我的存在。
 10. 新手的运气 一开始的成功会被无限放大。
 11. 认知失调 禀赋效应的一种。我们会合理化自己做出的错误选择。
  不科学的推断 1. 选择标准与结果 即便是有了全面且完善的信息，人们仍然有可能做出错误的判断。把选择标准当作结果便是其中之典型。游泳能让身材变好吗？用了化妆品能变得像模特一样好看？上了哈佛就能如同校友一样功成名就？答案当然是否。只有好看的模特才会拍化妆品广告，不用化妆品也一样好看。不过这一问题的解决倒也简单，通过控制变量就可以知道这一推断的可笑之处。所以你还要上MBA课程吗？
解决办法：统计推断
 2. 过度自信 我们总是系统性地高估我们的学识和预测能力——而且高估得很厉害。
解决办法：认定自己是中下等人？开玩笑。请对所有预测持怀疑态度，尤其是当这些预测是由所谓的专家们作出的。请你在筹划任何事情时都从悲观的角度出发，作最坏的打算。这样你才会真正有机会，更现实一些地判断形势。
 3. 从众心理 只要别人做什么我也跟着做什么，我的行为就是正确的。换言之，越多的人认为一个想法正确，这个想法就更加正确，太荒谬了。跟风随大流在学生生涯表现得更加明显，学生们疯狂追逐所谓的好专业，没想明白就考研。</description>

      <description>The Market Forces of Supply and Demand Economists use the model of supply and demand to analyze competitive markets. In a competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers, each of whom has little or no influence on the market price.
1. The Demand Curve The demand curve shows how the quantity of a good demanded depends on the price. According to the law of demand, as the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded rises.</description>

      <description>Consumers, Producers, and the Efficiency of Markets 1. Consumer Surplus Consumer surplus equals buyers’ willingness to pay for a good minus the amount they actually pay, and it measures the benefit buyers get from participating in a market. Consumer surplus can be computed by finding the area below the demand curve and above the price.
 2. Producer Surplus Producer surplus equals the amount sellers receive for their goods minus their costs of production, and it measures the benefit sellers get from participating in a market.</description>

      <description>Externalities When a transaction between a buyer and seller directly affects a third party, the effect is called an externality. If an activity yields negative externalities, such as pollution, the socially optimal quantity in a market is less than the equilibrium quantity. If an activity yields positive externalities, such as technology spillovers, the socially optimal quantity is greater than the equilibrium quantity.
Governments pursue various policies to remedy the inefficiencies caused by externalities.</description>

      <description>The Costs of Production The goal of firms is to maximize profit, which equals total revenue minus total cost.
When analyzing a firm’s behavior, it is important to include all the opportunity costs of production. Some of the opportunity costs, such as the wages a firm pays its workers, are explicit. Other opportunity costs, such as the wages the firm owner gives up by working at the firm rather than taking another job, are implicit.</description>

      <description>When I started learning economics, I thought economics can teach me to make more money because the word ‘economics’ implied money in my first look. Undoubtablely, my thought is wrong. Therefore, when I decide to write the introduction article, I need to illustrate what is economics indeed.
Accrording to The Principle of Economics by Gregory Mankiw. Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources. Economists study how people make decisions.</description>

      <description>Introduction Bayesians view inference as belief dynamics. It uses evidence to update prior belief to posterior beliefs which serve as prior beliefs for future evidence.
Decision theory is a formal theory of decision making under uncertainty. A decision problem consists of three parts:
Possible actions \(a\) States of the world \(s\) Possible consequences \(c\)  The question is “what is the best action or decision?”
If I want to answer the question, I need to measure the “goodness” of consequences with the \(utility\) function \(u\), and likelihood of states with probability distribution \(p\).</description>

      <description>1. About Python 3 Python is a modern, object-oriented scripting language. There’s a core philosophy behind the Python language, which includes the following statements: Beautiful is better than ugly. It’s always a good idea to make your code elegant and readable. Explicit is better than implicit. Don’t make your readers guess what your code does, make it obvious. Simple is better than complex. If you can make it simple, do.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION The integers have gradually lost their association with superstition and mysticism, but their interest for mathematicians has never waned. Gauss, the foremost mathematician of modern times, who devoted himself to many different branches of mathematics, is said to have expressed his opinion of number theory in the remark, “Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and the theory of numbers is the queen of mathematics.”

      <description>THE INFINITUDE OF THE NUMBER SYSTEM. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION 1. The Principle of Mathematical Induction For any interger \(n\) has been reached we may write the next integer, \(n+1\). We express this property of the sequence of integers by saying that there are \(infinitely\) many integers. The sequence of integers represents the simplest and most natural example of the mathematical infinite, which plays a dominant role in modern mathematics. The step by step procedure of passing from \(n\) to \(n+1\) which generates the infinite sequence of integers also forms the basis of one of the most fundamental patterns of mathematical reasoning, the principle of mathematical induction.</description>

INTRODUCTION Number is the basis of modern mathematics. But what is number? What does it mean to say that \(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}=1\), \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}\), and \((-1)(-1)=1\)? We learned in school the mechanics of fractions and negative numbers, but for a real understanding of the number system we must go back to simpler elements.</description>

什么是数学 Mathematics as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will, the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection. Its basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and construction, generality and individuality. Though different traditions may emphasize different aspects, it is only the interplay of these antithetic forces and the struggle for their synthesis that constitute the life, usefulness, and supreme value of mathematical science.</description>

好事无需规划 Incremental, bottom-up, trial-and-error innovation yields moral progress, superior technologies, and greater wealth. Top-down mandates from centralized authorities are more likely to produce ethical disasters, technological stagnation, and persistent poverty. “Bad news is man-made, top-down, purposed stuff, imposed on history,” Matt Ridley writes in The Evolution of Everything. “Good news is accidental, unplanned, emergent stuff that gradually evolves.”
缓慢演进的、自下而上的、试错式的创新，产生了道德的进步、先进的技术和更多的财富。来自中央权威、自上而下的命令，更容易造成道德灾难、技术停滞和持续贫穷。“坏事都是人为的、自上而下的、刻意设计、故意强加给历史的东西，” Matt Ridley在《万物之进化》中写道。“好事都是意外的、未经计划的、缓慢演化的偶然事件。”</description>
