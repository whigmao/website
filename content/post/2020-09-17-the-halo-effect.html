<h1>Delusion One: The Halo Effect</h1>

<h1>Delusion Two: “The Delusion of Correlation and Causality”</h1>

<h1>Delusion Three: The Delusion of Single Explanations</h1>

<h1>Delusion Five: The Delusion of Rigorous Research</h1>

<h1>Delusion Six: The Delusion of Lasting Success</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost all high-performing companies regress over time. The promise of a blueprint for lasting success is attractive but not realistic.</p>

<div id="delusion-seven-the-delusion-of-absolute-performance" class="section level1">
<h1>Delusion Seven: The Delusion of Absolute Performance</h1>

<h1>Delusion Eight: The Delusion of the Wrong End of the Stick</h1>

<p>It may be true that successful companies often pursued a highly focused strategy, but that doesn’t mean highly focused strategies often lead to success.</p>

<h1>Delusion Nine: The Delusion of Organizational Physics</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Company performance doesn’t obey immutable laws of nature and can’t be predicted with the accuracy of science — despite our desire for certainty and order.</p>
