<p>There are no shortcuts.</p>
<p>不存在什么捷径。</p>
<p>There are no hacks.</p>
<p>不存在什么窍门。</p>
<p>If you want to take the easy road, I promise you: it's longer and more painful than the hard road.</p>
<p>如果你想走轻松的路，我保证：它比艰难的路更长更痛苦。</p>
<p>I know. I've lived it. I've ventured down the easy road at times in my life and it never led to anywhere good. The positive things in my life always came when I faced the biggest challenges.</p>
<p>我知道。我亲身经历过。在我人生中我冒险走过轻松的路，从未达到什么好结果。在我生活中，积极的事情总是发生在我面临最大挑战的时候。</p>
<p>I joined the Navy. I took the hard road in the Navy and made it into the SEAL Teams. There, I had the honor of leading men in combat. I learned some lessons along the way, lessons that have been tested on the battlefield and, when implemented, lead to success in any arena.</p>
<p>我加入了海军。我选择了海军中最艰难的路，成为海豹突击队的一员。在那里，我有幸成为作战中的领军人物。一路走来我学到不少教训，经过战场考验的教训，实践这些教训可在任何领域取得成功。</p>
<p>One of the best things I've learned is that anyone has what it takes to travel the hard road – to walk The Path that leads to success. That includes you. It won't be easy. It will demand everything you've got to give. But you can do it, and I want to give you three key principles I've learned that will help you to get it done.</p>
<p>我学到的最佳教训是，人人都拥有战胜艰难险阻的能力——走向成功的道路。这也包括你。那可不会轻松。它将要求你全力付出。但你是能做到的，而我想把我学到的三条基本原则告诉你，它们将有助于你实现它。</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="principle-number-one-discipline-equals-freedom">Principle number one: Discipline Equals Freedom</h2>
<h2 id="heading-1">第一条原则：自律等于自由</h2>
<p>That's not a contradiction – it's an equation. Discipline might appear to be the opposite of freedom. But, in fact, discipline is the path to freedom.</p>
<p>这不矛盾——这是条等式。自律似乎是自由的对立面。但实际上，自律是通向自由之路。</p>
<p>Discipline is the driver of daily execution. Discipline defeats the infinite excuses that hold you back.</p>
<p>自律是日常执行力的驱动者。自律战胜拖你后腿的无数理由。</p>
<p>Some people think motivation is what will compel them to get things done. But motivation is just an emotion – a feeling, and like all feelings, it's fickle: it comes and goes. You can't count on motivation to be there when you need to get through truly challenging times.</p>
<p>有人认为，迫使人们完成任务的是动机。但动机不过是种情感——一种感受，就像所有感受，它反复无常：它来去匆匆。你不能指望当你需要度过真正具有挑战性的时刻时，动机就会随时出现。</p>
<p>But you can count on discipline. Discipline is something you dictate.</p>
<p>但你能指望自律。自律是由你支配的。</p>
<p>Motivation won't make you exercise every day; discipline will. Motivation won't stay up late and finish a project for you; discipline will. Motivation isn't going to get you out of bed in the morning; discipline will. Make discipline part of your daily life and your daily life will get better.</p>
<p>动机无法令你每日锻炼；自律可以。动机无法熬夜替你完成计划；自律可以。动机无法让你早上从床上爬起来；自律可以。让自律成为你日常生活的一部分，你的日常生活就能好起来。</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="principle-number-two-stay-humble">Principle Number Two: Stay Humble</h2>
<h2 id="heading-2">第二条原则：保持谦逊</h2>
<p>In life, you are going to have to do things that you don't want to do. Maybe things that you don't think you should have to do – things that offend your precious ego.</p>
<p>在生活中，你必须做你不想做的事。也许是一些你认为你不应该做的事——一些冒犯到你宝贵自我的事。</p>
<p>When I got done with Basic SEAL Training and reported on board SEAL Team One, you know what I was assigned to do? I was assigned to clean toilets. That's right – despite having just graduated some of the most difficult military training in the world, despite being assigned to an &ldquo;elite&rdquo; commando unit – my first mission at the actual SEAL Team was to clean toilets. Not exactly a glorious job.</p>
<p>当我完成基本海豹突击队训练，到海豹突击一队报道，你知道我被指派做什么吗？我被指派清洁马桶。真的——尽管我刚刚完成了世界上一些难度最大的军事训练，尽管被指派到「精英」突击队——我在真正的海豹突击队的第一次任务是清洁马桶。不怎么是个光荣的任务。</p>
<p>But you know what? I did it. I did it to the best of my ability and took pride in doing it well. And that attitude got noticed: if I cared that much about how clean the toilets were, people knew I would do a good job with even more important assignments. After a short period of time, I got those more important assignments. But it was humility that opened the door for me.</p>
<p>但你知道吗？我做了。我尽全力完成，为做得好而自豪。而这种态度得到注意：如果我在意马桶有多干净，他们知道我能很好地完成更重要的任务。过了一阵子，我得到了一些更重要的任务。但谦虚是我的敲门砖。</p>
<p>Now, being humble does not mean that you shouldn't be confident. You certainly have to believe that you are a capable person. But don't let confidence turn into arrogance. So keep your ego in check and stay humble.</p>
<p>保持谦虚不意味着你不应该自信。你当然得相信你是个有能力的人。但别让自信变成自大。所以节制一下你的自我，保持谦虚。</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-third-and-final-principle-take-ownership-of-everything">The third and final principle: Take Ownership Of Everything</h2>
<h2 id="heading-3">第三个原则，也是最后一个：承担一切事情的责任</h2>
<p>I call this &ldquo;Extreme Ownership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>我称之为「极端责任感」。</p>
<p>In the military, the best leaders and the best troops were the ones that took ownership of everything in their world – not just the things they were responsible for, but for every challenge and obstacle that impacted their mission.</p>
<p>在军队，是最佳领导和最佳部队，在他们的世界中承担一切事情的责任——不仅他们的职责，也包括影响到他们任务的所有挑战和阻碍。</p>
<p>When something went wrong: They cast no blame, they made no excuses. They took ownership of the problem and fixed it.</p>
<p>当事情变糟：他们不自责，他们不找借口。他们承担起这个问题的责任并解决它。</p>
<p>You can implement this attitude as well – not only in your job, but in your life. Let other people blame their parents, their boss, or the system. Let weaker people complain that the world isn't fair. You are the leader of your life: take ownership of everything in it.</p>
<p>你也可以实施这个态度——不仅用在你的工作上，也用在你的生活中。让其他人埋怨他们的父母，他们的上司，或者这个制度。让弱者抱怨这个世界是不公平的。你是你自己人生的领导者：承担起其中的一切责任。</p>
<p>So: be disciplined in all that you do. Don't subject yourself to the whims of motivation. Stay humble and be willing to do what needs to be done.</p>
<p>所以：你行为处事时保持自律。不要服从一时的动机。保持谦虚并乐于做必须做的事。</p>
<p>And: take extreme ownership of your life and everything in it.</p>
<p>还有：承担起你生活中一切事情的责任。</p>
<p>Then: choose the hard path – the path of responsibility, hard work, and sacrifice. The Path of discipline, humility, and ownership that ultimately leads to freedom.</p>
<p>接着：选择艰难的路——责任、努力和奉献的路。自律、谦逊和责任，最终走向自由的路。</p>
<p>If you follow these principles, then nothing in the world will stop you.</p>
<p>如果你遵循这些原则，世界上没有任何东西能阻止你。</p>
