      <description>我们选择在美国大兵再次挺身而出拯救世界（好吧，至少是一趟火车中的五百人小世界）的今天，发表这篇 Azar Gat 写于 2007 年的雄文，相信这是对美利坚这份上帝厚礼表达感激之情的恰当方式，愿自由之火不熄，美利坚孤舟不沉。

THE END OF THE END OF HISTORY “历史终结” 论的终结
 【译注：《历史的终结》是美国学者弗朗西斯 · 福山（Francis Fukuyama）1989 年发表的一篇文章，后又于 1992 年扩写成书。福山认为自由民主制是人类社会演化的终点。】
 Today’s global liberal democratic order faces two challenges. The first is radical Islam — and it is the lesser of the two challenges. Although the proponents of radical Islam find liberal democracy repugnant, and the movement is often described as the new fascist threat, the societies from which it arises are generally poor and stagnant.</description>

      <title>Everything has a diminishing marginal utility</title>

      <description>As an popular economic concept, diminishing marginal utility is not new. We all know that utility deriving from a product or commodity reduces as more and more we consume of it.
The utility, here, can be defined as a level of satisfaction that we get from a consumption of a commodity. On the contrary it can be defined as lack of desire to consume more of it.
When I look back to the history of competence, I surprisingly find out that almost everything has a diminishing marginal utility.</description>

      <description>The Markets for the Factors of Production The economy’s income is distributed in the markets for the factors of production. The three most important factors of production are labor, land, and capital.
The demand for factors, such as labor, is a derived demand that comes from firms that use the factors to produce goods and services. Competitive, profitmaximizing firms hire each factor up to the point at which the value of the factor’s marginal product equals its price.</description>

      <title>Economics: The Theory of Consumer Choice and Other Topics</title>

      <description>Consumer Choice A consumer’s budget constraint shows the possible combinations of different goods she can buy given her income and the prices of the goods. The slope of the budget constraint equals the relative price of the goods.
The consumer’s indifference curves represent her preferences. An indifference curve shows the various bundles of goods that make the consumer equally happy. Points on higher indifference curves are preferred to points on lower indifference curves.</description>

      <title>Economics: How Market Works</title>

      <description>The Market Forces of Supply and Demand Economists use the model of supply and demand to analyze competitive markets. In a competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers, each of whom has little or no influence on the market price.
1. The Demand Curve The demand curve shows how the quantity of a good demanded depends on the price. According to the law of demand, as the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded rises.</description>

      <description>Consumers, Producers, and the Efficiency of Markets 1. Consumer Surplus Consumer surplus equals buyers’ willingness to pay for a good minus the amount they actually pay, and it measures the benefit buyers get from participating in a market. Consumer surplus can be computed by finding the area below the demand curve and above the price.
 2. Producer Surplus Producer surplus equals the amount sellers receive for their goods minus their costs of production, and it measures the benefit sellers get from participating in a market.</description>

      <title>Economics: The Economics of the Public Sector</title>

      <description>Externalities When a transaction between a buyer and seller directly affects a third party, the effect is called an externality. If an activity yields negative externalities, such as pollution, the socially optimal quantity in a market is less than the equilibrium quantity. If an activity yields positive externalities, such as technology spillovers, the socially optimal quantity is greater than the equilibrium quantity.
Governments pursue various policies to remedy the inefficiencies caused by externalities.</description>

      <description>The Costs of Production The goal of firms is to maximize profit, which equals total revenue minus total cost.
When analyzing a firm’s behavior, it is important to include all the opportunity costs of production. Some of the opportunity costs, such as the wages a firm pays its workers, are explicit. Other opportunity costs, such as the wages the firm owner gives up by working at the firm rather than taking another job, are implicit.</description>

      <description>When I started learning economics, I thought economics can teach me to make more money because the word ‘economics’ implied money in my first look. Undoubtablely, my thought is wrong. Therefore, when I decide to write the introduction article, I need to illustrate what is economics indeed.
Accrording to The Principle of Economics by Gregory Mankiw. Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources. Economists study how people make decisions.</description>
