      <description>1. About Python 3 Python is a modern, object-oriented scripting language. There’s a core philosophy behind the Python language, which includes the following statements: Beautiful is better than ugly. It’s always a good idea to make your code elegant and readable. Explicit is better than implicit. Don’t make your readers guess what your code does, make it obvious. Simple is better than complex. If you can make it simple, do.</description>

      <description>Introduction Now more than ever, you hear about the importance of STEM education and the need for qualified computer programmers. This article is designed for you, someone who’s curious to pull back the curtains and explore the world of computer programming. I’ll walk you through your first line of code, explain the core concepts needed to write useful programs, and take a peek at several programming languages along the way.</description>

      <description>INTRODUCTION The integers have gradually lost their association with superstition and mysticism, but their interest for mathematicians has never waned. Gauss, the foremost mathematician of modern times, who devoted himself to many different branches of mathematics, is said to have expressed his opinion of number theory in the remark, “Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and the theory of numbers is the queen of mathematics.”

      <title>Book Review: R for Data Science</title>

      <description>After reading the book: R for Data Science, I plan to write a book review to summary some important skills I learned from the book and shed new light on the future study direction. The book helps me understand the whole diagram about data science, and what role R plays in the diagram. However, the book is not a definitive guide. These are a lot of important topics, such as TensorFlow, model building and non-rectangular data, not appearing in the book.</description>

      <description>THE INFINITUDE OF THE NUMBER SYSTEM. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION 1. The Principle of Mathematical Induction For any interger \(n\) has been reached we may write the next integer, \(n+1\). We express this property of the sequence of integers by saying that there are \(infinitely\) many integers. The sequence of integers represents the simplest and most natural example of the mathematical infinite, which plays a dominant role in modern mathematics. The step by step procedure of passing from \(n\) to \(n+1\) which generates the infinite sequence of integers also forms the basis of one of the most fundamental patterns of mathematical reasoning, the principle of mathematical induction.</description>

INTRODUCTION Number is the basis of modern mathematics. But what is number? What does it mean to say that \(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}=1\), \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}\), and \((-1)(-1)=1\)? We learned in school the mechanics of fractions and negative numbers, but for a real understanding of the number system we must go back to simpler elements.</description>

什么是数学 Mathematics as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will, the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection. Its basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and construction, generality and individuality. Though different traditions may emphasize different aspects, it is only the interplay of these antithetic forces and the struggle for their synthesis that constitute the life, usefulness, and supreme value of mathematical science.</description>

好事无需规划 Incremental, bottom-up, trial-and-error innovation yields moral progress, superior technologies, and greater wealth. Top-down mandates from centralized authorities are more likely to produce ethical disasters, technological stagnation, and persistent poverty. “Bad news is man-made, top-down, purposed stuff, imposed on history,” Matt Ridley writes in The Evolution of Everything. “Good news is accidental, unplanned, emergent stuff that gradually evolves.”
缓慢演进的、自下而上的、试错式的创新，产生了道德的进步、先进的技术和更多的财富。来自中央权威、自上而下的命令，更容易造成道德灾难、技术停滞和持续贫穷。“坏事都是人为的、自上而下的、刻意设计、故意强加给历史的东西，” Matt Ridley在《万物之进化》中写道。“好事都是意外的、未经计划的、缓慢演化的偶然事件。”</description>
