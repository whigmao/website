      <description>Introduction Bayesians view inference as belief dynamics. It uses evidence to update prior belief to posterior beliefs which serve as prior beliefs for future evidence.
Decision theory is a formal theory of decision making under uncertainty. A decision problem consists of three parts:
Possible actions \(a\) States of the world \(s\) Possible consequences \(c\)  The question is “what is the best action or decision?”
If I want to answer the question, I need to measure the “goodness” of consequences with the \(utility\) function \(u\), and likelihood of states with probability distribution \(p\).</description>
