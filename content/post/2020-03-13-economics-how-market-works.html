<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> The Market Forces of Supply and Demand</h1>
<p>Economists use the model of supply and demand to analyze <strong>competitive markets</strong>. In a competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers, each of whom has little or no influence on the market price.</p>
<div id="the-demand-curve" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The Demand Curve</h2>
<p>The demand curve shows how the quantity of a good demanded depends on the price. According to the law of demand, as the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded rises. Therefore, the demand curve slopes downward.</p>
<p>In addition to price, other determinants of how much consumers want to buy include income, the prices of substitutes and complements, tastes, expectations, and the number of buyers. If one of these factors changes, the demand curve shifts.</p>
<p>The demand curve is also different between normal goods and inferior good.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-supply-curve" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The Supply Curve</h2>
<p>The supply curve shows how the quantity of a good supplied depends on the price. According to the law of supply, as the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied rises. Therefore, the supply curve slopes upward.</p>
<p>In addition to price, other determinants of how much producers want to sell include input prices, technology, expectations, and the number of sellers. If one of these factors changes, the supply curve shifts.</p>
</div>
<div id="equilibrium" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Equilibrium</h2>
<p>The intersection of the supply and demand curves determines the market equilibrium. At the equilibrium
price, the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.</p>
<p>The behavior of buyers and sellers naturally drives markets toward their equilibrium. When the market price is above the equilibrium price, there is a surplus of the good, which causes the market price to fall. When the market price is below the equilibrium price, there is a shortage, which causes the market price to rise.</p>
<p>To analyze how any event influences a market, we use the supply-and-demand diagram to examine how the event affects the equilibrium price and quantity. To do this, we follow three steps. First, we decide whether the event shifts the supply curve or the demand curve (or both). Second, we decide in which direction the curve shifts. Third, we compare the new equilibrium with the initial equilibrium.</p>
<p>In market economies, prices are the signals that guide economic decisions and thereby allocate scarce resources. For every good in the economy, the price ensures that supply and demand are in balance. The equilibrium price then determines how much of the good buyers choose to consume and how much sellers choose to produce.</p>

<div id="elasticity-and-its-application" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Elasticity and Its Application</h1>
<div id="the-price-elasticity-of-demand" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The price elasticity of demand</h2>
<p>The price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded responds to changes in the price. Demand tends to be more elastic if close substitutes are available, if the good is a luxury rather than a necessity, if the market is narrowly defined, or if buyers have substantial time to react to a price change.</p>
<p>The price elasticity of demand is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. If quantity demanded moves proportionately less than the price, then the elasticity is less than 1 and demand is said to be inelastic. If quantity demanded moves proportionately more than the price, then the elasticity is greater than 1 and demand is said to be elastic.</p>
<p>Total revenue, the total amount paid for a good, equals the price of the good times the quantity sold. For inelastic demand curves, total revenue moves in the same direction as the price. For elastic demand curves, total revenue moves in the opposite direction as the price.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-income-elasticity-of-demand" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> The income elasticity of demand</h2>
<p>The income elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded responds to changes in consumers’ income. The cross-price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of one good responds to changes in the price of another good.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-price-elasticity-of-supply" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> The price elasticity of supply</h2>
<p>The price elasticity of supply measures how much the quantity supplied responds to changes in the price. This elasticity often depends on the time horizon under consideration. In most markets, supply is more elastic in the long run than in the short run.</p>
<p>The price elasticity of supply is calculated as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price. If quantity supplied moves proportionately less than the price, then the elasticity is less than 1 and supply is said to be inelastic. If quantity supplied moves proportionately more than the price, then the elasticity is greater than 1 and supply is said to be elastic.</p>
<p>The tools of supply and demand can be applied in many different kinds of markets, not only in competitive market.</p>
</div>
<div id="application" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Application</h2>
<p>For any given price of wheat, it is better to use the new hybrid to produce and sell more wheat. Yet when all farmers do this, the supply of wheat increases, the price falls, and farmers are worse off.</p>
<p>The example goes to the heart of how competitive markets work. Because each farmer is only a small part of the market for wheat, she takes the price of wheat as given. It may at first seem hypothetical, but it helps to explain a major change in the U.S. economy over the past century. Two hundred years ago, most Americans lived on farms. Knowledge about farm methods was sufficiently primitive that most Americans had to be farmers to produce enough food to feed the nation’s population. But over time, advances in farm technology increased the amount of food that each farmer could produce. This increase in food supply, together with the inelastic demand for food, caused farm revenues to fall, which in turn encouraged people to leave farming.</p>
<p>This analysis of the market for farm products also explains a seeming paradox of public policy: Certain farm programs try to help farmers by inducing them not to plant crops on all of their land. The purpose of these programs is to reduce the supply of farm products and thereby raise prices. With inelastic demand for their products, farmers as a group receive greater total revenue if they supply a smaller crop to the market. No single farmer would choose to leave her land fallow on her own because each takes the market price as given. But if all farmers do so together, they can all be better off.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Supply, Demand, and Government Policies</h1>
<div id="price-ceiling" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Price Ceiling</h2>
<p>A price ceiling is a legal maximum on the price of a good or service. An example is <strong>rent control</strong>. If the price ceiling is below the equilibrium price, then the price ceiling is binding, and the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. Because of the resulting shortage, sellers must in some way ration the good or service among buyers.</p>
</div>
<div id="price-floor" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> price floor</h2>
<p>A price floor is a legal minimum on the price of a good or service. An example is the <strong>minimum wage</strong>. If the price floor is above the equilibrium price, then the price floor is binding, and the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. Because of the resulting surplus, buyers’ demands for the good or service must in some way be rationed among sellers.</p>
</div>
<div id="tax" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Tax</h2>
<p>When the government levies a tax on a good, the equilibrium quantity of the good falls. That is, a tax on a market shrinks the size of the market.</p>
<p>A tax on a good places a wedge between the price paid by buyers and the price received by sellers. When the market moves to the new equilibrium, buyers pay more for the good and sellers receive less for it. In this sense, buyers and sellers share the tax burden. The incidence of a tax (that is, the division of the tax burden) does not depend on whether the tax is levied on buyers or sellers.</p>
<p>The incidence of a tax depends on the price elasticities of supply and demand. Most of the burden falls on the side of the market that is less elastic because that side of the market cannot respond as easily to the tax by changing the quantity bought or sold.</p>
</div>
<div id="application-who-pays-the-luxury-tax" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Application: WHO PAYS THE LUXURY TAX?</h2>
<p>In 1990, Congress adopted a new luxury tax on items such as yachts, private airplanes, furs, jewelry, and expensive cars. The goal of the tax was to raise revenue from those who could most easily afford to pay. Because only the rich could afford to buy such extravagances, taxing luxuries seemed a logical way of taxing the rich.</p>
<p>Yet, when the forces of supply and demand took over, the outcome was quite different from the one Congress intended. Consider, for example, the market for yachts. The demand for yachts is quite elastic. A millionaire can easily not buy a yacht; he can use the money to buy a bigger house, take a European vacation, or leave a larger bequest to his heirs. By contrast, the supply of yachts is relatively inelastic, at least in the short run. Yacht factories are not easily converted to alternative uses, and workers who build yachts are not eager to change careers in response to changing market conditions.</p>
<p>Our analysis makes a clear prediction in this case. With elastic demand and inelastic supply, the burden of a tax falls largely on the suppliers. That is, a tax on yachts places a burden largely on the firms and workers who build yachts because they end up getting a significantly lower price for their product. The workers, however, are not wealthy. Thus, the burden of a luxury tax falls more on the middle class than on the rich.</p>
<p>The mistaken assumptions about the incidence of the luxury tax quickly became apparent after the tax went into effect. Suppliers of luxuries made their congressional representatives well aware of the economic hardship they experienced, and Congress repealed most of the luxury tax in 1993.</p>
