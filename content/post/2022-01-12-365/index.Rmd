A growing science of learning: highly
effective, evidence- based strategies to replace less effective but
widely accepted practices that are rooted in theory, lore, and
intuition. But there’s a catch: the most effective learning strategies are not intuitive.

WE apply two of the primary learning principles in the book: spaced
repetition of key ideas, and the interleaving of different but
related topics.

If learners spread out their study of a topic,
returning to it periodically over time, they remember it better.
Similarly, if they interleave the study of different topics, they
learn each better than if they had studied them one at a time in
sequence. 

While much remains to be known about learning and its
neural underpinnings, a large body of research has yielded
principles and practical strategies that can be put to work immediately, at no cost, and to great effect.
