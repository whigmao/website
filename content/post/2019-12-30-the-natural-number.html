<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Number is the basis of modern mathematics. But what is number? What does it mean to say that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((-1)(-1)=1\)</span>? We learned in school the mechanics of fractions and negative numbers, but for a real understanding of the number system we must go back to simpler elements. We shall accept the natural numbers as given, together with the two fundamental operations, <strong>addition and multiplication</strong>, by which they may be combined.</p>

<h2>1.Laws of Arithmetic</h2>
<p>The mathematical theory of the natural numbers or <span class="math inline">\(positive \ integers\)</span> is known as <span class="math inline">\(arithmetic\)</span>. It is based on the fact that the addition and multiplication of integers are governed by certain laws. We shall denote integers symbolically by letters <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c,…\)</span>. With this agreement we may state five fundamental laws of arithmetic:</p>
<p>1.<span class="math inline">\(a+b=b+a\)</span></p>
<p>2.<span class="math inline">\(ab=ba\)</span></p>
<p>3.<span class="math inline">\(a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c\)</span></p>
<p>4.<span class="math inline">\(a(bc)=(ab)c\)</span></p>
<p>5.<span class="math inline">\(a(b+c)=ab+ac\)</span></p>
<p>The first two of these, the <span class="math inline">\(commulative\)</span> laws of addition and multiplication, state that one may interchange the order of the elements involved in addition and multiplication. The third, the <span class="math inline">\(associative\)</span> law of addition, states that addition of three numbers gives the same result whether we add to the first the sum of the second and third, or to the third the sum of the first and second. The fourth is the <span class="math inline">\(associative\)</span> law of multiplication. The last, the <span class="math inline">\(distributive\)</span> law, expresses the fact that to muliply a sum by an integer we may multiply each term of the sum by this integer and then add the products.
These laws of arithemetic are very simple, and may seem obvious. But the might not be applicable to entities other than integers. If <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are symbols not for integers but for chemical substances, and if “addition” is uded in a colloquial sense, it is evident that the commutative law will not alwasy hold.
On the basis of the definition of addition of two integers we may define the relation of <span class="math inline">\(inequality\)</span>. Each of the equivalen statements, <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; b\)</span> (read, “<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is less than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>”) and <span class="math inline">\(b &gt; a\)</span> (read, “<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is greater than <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>”), means that box <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> may be obtained from box <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> by the addition of a properly chosen third box <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, so that <span class="math inline">\(b=a+c\)</span>.
Addition and subtraction are said to be <span class="math inline">\(inverse \ operations\)</span>, since if the addition of the integer <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> to the integer <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is followed by the subtraction of the integer <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, the result is the original integer <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>:
<span class="math inline">\((a+d)-d=a\)</span>.
It should be noted that the integer <span class="math inline">\(b-a\)</span> has been defined only when <span class="math inline">\(b&gt;a\)</span>. The interpretation of the symbol <span class="math inline">\(b-a\)</span> as a <span class="math inline">\(negative \ integer\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(b&lt;a\)</span> will be discussed later.</p>

<h2>2.The Representation of Integers</h2>
<p>We must carefully distinguish between an integer and the symbol, <span class="math inline">\(5,V,…\)</span> used to represent it. It is very useful to have a way of indicating the result in perfect generality by a single formula. We may do this if we denote the different coefficients, <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c,…,\)</span> by the single letter <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> with different “subscripts,” <span class="math inline">\(a_0, a_1, a_2, …,\)</span> and indicate the fact that the powers of ten may be as large as necessary. Then th general method for representing an integer <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> in the decimal system is to express <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> in the form:
<span class="math inline">\(z=a_n \cdot 10^n+ a_{n-1} \cdot 10^{n-1}+…+a_1 \cdot 10+a_0\)</span>,
and to represent it by the symbol
<span class="math inline">\(a_na_{n-1}a_{n-2}…a_1a_0\)</span>.
In the decimal system the number ten is singled out to serve as a base. The layman may not realize that the selection of ten is not essential, and that any integer greater than one would serve that same purpose. For example, a <span class="math inline">\(septimal\)</span> system (base 7) could be used. In such a system, an integer would be expressed as
<span class="math inline">\(b_n \cdot 7^n+b_{n-1} \cdot 7^{n-1}+…+b_1 \cdot 7+b_0\)</span>,
where the <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>’s arc digits from zero to six.
The general rule for passing from the base ten to any other base <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is to perform successive divisions of the number <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>; the remainders will be the digits of the number in the system with base <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. For exampel:
109 (decimal system) = 214 (septimal system)</p>

<h2>3.Computation in Systems Other than the Decimal</h2>
<p>The use of ten as a base goes back to the dawn of civilization, and is undoubtedly due to the fact that we have ten fingers on which to count. But the number words of many languages show remnants of the use of other bases, notably twelve and twenty.
In a system other than the decimal the rules of arithmetic are the same, but one must use different tables for the addition and multiplication of digits.
From a theoretical point of view, the positional system with the base 2 is singled out as the one with the smallest possible base. The only digits in this <span class="math inline">\(dyadic \ system\)</span> are 0 and 1; every other number <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is represented by a row of these symbols. The addition and multiplication tables consist merely of the rules <span class="math inline">\(1+1=10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1 \cdot 1=1\)</span>. But the disadvantage of this system is obvious: long expressions are needed to represent small numbers. Thus <span class="math inline">\(79\)</span>. which may be expressed as <span class="math inline">\(1,001,111\)</span>.
As an illystration of the simplicity of multiplication in the dyadic system, we shall multiply <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, which are respectively <span class="math inline">\(111\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(101\)</span>. Remembering that <span class="math inline">\(1+1=10\)</span> in this system, we have the result <span class="math inline">\(100011\)</span>, which is <span class="math inline">\(35\)</span>, as it should be.</p>

<p>Leibniz saw in his binary arithemetic the image of creation. He imageined that Unity represented God, and zero the void; that the Superme Being drew all beings from the void, just as unity and zero express all numbers in his system of numeration–Laplace.</p>
