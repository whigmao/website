> Nothing New. Common sense in economics and decision science.

## 1. THINK CLEARLY

1. Thinking on the margin is one of the best ways to clarify our thinking because it reduces the scope of the problem and wipe away extraneous clutter.

2. Making distinction helps us see the real problem clearly and, in addition, can help us resolve differences in debates.

3. The authors also explore the "I must" trap that many of us fall into and explained how we can free ourselves by focusing on goals rather than on obligations. If you really don't like aspects of your life, change them. But those that you do accept, accept for good reasons.

4. Speaking of reasons, we discussed how the reasons we use to explain our choices are often actually a result of our choices and are not always factors in making them. Our focus should shift from reasons to the different outcomes of our choices.

5. The book introduce decision trees as a  useful and powerful way of structureing problems with alternatives, uncertainties, and outcomes.

## 2. THINK VALUE

1. One good way to determine value is to look at opportunity costs-- the cost, through foregone enjoyment or financial return, that you incur by no pursuing other promising opportunities. 

2. When calculating costs, we need to be careful not to include sunk costs. They are sunk-- already incurred-- and should be irrelevant to our decision making.

3. Value is subjective, in the eye of the beholder.

4. Value of life and time is not infinitely and can be count.

## 3. ASK WHAT CHANGED

1. In our quest for understanding, knowing what drives any given situation is paramount. If we didn't have a problem before and now we do, something must have changed.

2. Investors who ask what changed and whether the change is permanent or not will have a distinct advantage.

3. As Newton warned, that body may stay at rest until an outside force requires it to change.

---

## 4. KNOW WHAT YOU WANT BEFORE YOU CHOOSE

1. Customer is not always right. Companies shouldn't sacritice more important objectives to achieve customer satisfaction because customer satisfaction is a means to an end, not an end itself.

2. Don't forget market share, which, like customer service, is usually a means, not an end in itself.

3. If you are clear about what you want before you choose, you can avoid the pitfalls.

## 5. BIASES AFFECT THE BEST OF US

1. Biased usually results from an incomplete view. Perhaps the observer was lazy and stopped looking further, or perhaps the observer witnessed something that was internally consistent and simply fit with his or her preexisting beliefs. 

2. The viewer may not even be technically wrong. It is as if the biased person is right about a tree but wrong about the forest.

3. How coincidences can mislead us because we inflate their importance.

4. By addressing and correcting some of our biases, we can see the world more clearly and make better decisions in the process. If our biases are causing us to see the world incorrectly, we should discard them as we would ditorted glassed.

## 6. REALIZE WHAT IS IMPORTANT

1. Focusing on less-important objectives will lead you to the wrong conclusion.

2. We are all limited in some way or another. Your constrained resource is your most important one. This is one of the biggest insights to arise from the field of optimization.

---

## 7. CREATE BETTER ALTERNATIVES

1. When we make a decision, we are actively selecting one of many alternatives. The first mistake people frequently make is to stop their search much too early and not explore other ideas.

2. Decision-makers need to take two steps to be successful. The first is somewhat passive: consider the available alternatives. The second, and more active step is to create new, potentially better alternatives.

Here are some simple rules for thinking clearly:

a. Think about what you want

b. Think of alternatives that give you what you want

c. Consider what you like and dislike about each existing alternative

d. Create hybrid alternatives, those that combine the best elements from the existing alternatives.

e. Throw out all impossible alternatives

f. Pick the best alternative.

---

## 8. CONSCIOUSLY SELECT THE BEST ALTERNATIVE

1. When we make decisions or take actions, we commit resources. So carefully think through the downstream consequences of today's decision. A little upfront thinking has a huge payoff later.

2. Assuming there are no ethical issues involved, the choice should be the one with the best consequences.


3. Make decisions that logically have a good chance of a good outcome; don't plan on being lucky.

4. Make effort proportional to the importance of the decision.

5. Realize that often we aren't locking ourselves into huge decisions, but are instead buying options. Consciously think of the decision as involving options and then buy the options if doing so makes sense.

6. Many decisions involve choices where various outcomes have various probabilities of occurring. For such problems, build a decision tree and try to estimate the values of outcomes and probabilities.

## 9. RISK IS PART OF GROWTH

1. Risk is one of those things that in large doses can kill, while in smaller doses simply makes us stronger.

2. Your dose can be determined by evaluating a risk tolerance number. Then you can use the *Risk_Adverse Expected Net Present Value Approach* to evaluate any venture to determine if it is too risky for you. If is is too risky, either walk away or find a way to reduce the risk. Risk can be reduced by delaying the expenditures, accelerating failure, or simply shareing it with others.

## 10 EXPLOIT INEQUALITY

1. Balance and proportionality are needed so that we apply the right level of effort to each problem. Such insights are the essence of the *80/20 Rule* and *Factor 16*.

---

## 11. KNOW THE VALUE OF INFORMATION

1. Information is a precious resource and a decision-maker should make sure he or she has the right amount.

2. Decision science shows us how to calculate the value of any piece of information capable resolving a press issue.

3. *One-Percent Rule* can help us set our information budget before we dive into a project.

4. The lesson of *The Data Trap* help us focus our energy on the right information.

5. Information has costs and benefits. We need to gather the right amount of information to understand a situation and act clearly and quickly.

---

## 12. THINK SIMPLE

1. Simple doesn't mean simpleminded. You have to be clever and persistent to simplify an issue to its core essence, but once you do, you will realize it was worth the effort.

2. Use thresholds to show what is required, and use analogies to apply what you already know to new situation.

---

## 13. THINK ARBITRAGE

1. Arbitrage is the action of buying something from one person and then selling it to another person, essentially unchanged but at a higher price.

2. We have seen how exploiting arbitrage opportunities benefits profitability, because all parties involved benefit from such exchanges.

## 14. DO THE RIGHT THING

1. Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.

2. Only by focusing on the needs of others and caring about them at some level, do we further our own goals and objectives. 

3. People selfishly promote their own ends by finding out what other need and want and helping them get these things. In other words, people frequently don't do what they want, but what others want them to do. And the reason they do what others want is that those others are willing to put their money where their wants are, and pay for having those things done.

4. Doing good for others is not the same as self-sacrifice or self-denial. This whole process, in fact, starts with the self, starts that is, with you and an assessment of your values and objectives.

5. In competition for friends, spouses, customers, and coworkers, we realize that others have choices, and if we don't give them what they want, they many choose someone else.

6. Your code of ethics is your personal constitution.

7. Always tell the truth; then you don't have to remember anything.

8. The next difficulty with lying and cheating is the message it conveys to family members, loved ones, friends, and coworkers. They see and hear how you treat others and get the hint that, "I will cheat them. Watch out because you may be next."

9. Another problem with unethical behavior is that the truth may become known at any time, resulting in painful outcomes.

10. We will readily admit that there are unethical and dishonest people who succeed for years or decades. The lure of unethical behavior is strong, but it is largely a siren call attracting those who don't really understand how life works. The purchase price of unethical behavior is low, but it is the maintenance costs that will kill you. Dishonest people cleverly sacrifice the war to try to win some battles; they seek painless, yet unethical ways to make money in the short-term, but this impedes their long-term growth and success.

11. No man can be dishonest without soon being found out and when his lack of principle is discovered, nearly every avenue to success is closed against his forever. As a mere matter of selfishness, honesty is the best policy.

12. Ask yourself how you would feel to see your latest policy or behavior on the front page of the *New York Times*. If you don't feel proud knowing this, don't do it. THe second technique is to live by higher standards than the times require. 

13. We can lie to our enemies.
