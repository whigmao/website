<p>W: When I think about what those definitions are capitalism to me, it’s an ideology of capital. The most important thing is the concentration of capital and it means that we seek and prioritize profit and the accumulation of money above all else and we seek it at any human and environmental cost that is what that means.</p>
<p>No wrong, so wrong</p>
<p>It’s exactly backwards and I’ll prove it to you</p>
<p>On Amazon lately, each of the thousands of products amazon offers represents the work of people who believe they have something you want or need if they’re right they prosper if they’re wrong they don’t that’s how the free market works it encourages people to improve their lives by satisfying the needs of others.</p>
<p>No one starts a business making a thing or providing a service for themselves. They start a business to make things or provide services for other.</p>
<p>W: When we talk about ideas, for example, like democratic socialism, it means putting democracy and society first instead of capital first.</p>
<p>In a socialist economy the government has the ultimate power it decides what you get from the limited supply, it decides what should exist. Instead of millions of people making millions of decisions about what they want. a few people – government elites – decide what people should have and how much they should pay for it.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, they always get it wrong. Have you ever noticed that late stage socialist failures always run out of essential items like toilet paper</p>
<p>W: Because at the end of the day as workers and as people of society were the ones creating wealth not a corporate CEO it’s not a CEO that’s make that’s actually creating four billion dollars a year. It is the millions of workers in this country that’s creating billions of dollars of economic productivity a year.</p>
<p>I speak from personal experience when I was the CEO of the company that owns
Carl’s jr. and Hardees restaurant chains, we spent millions of dollars every year trying to determine what customers wanted if our customers didn’t like something we changed it and fast because if we didn’t our competitors would plan intended eat us for lunch the consumer that’s you has the ultimate power in effect you vote with every dollar you spend and that’s why the emphasis in democratic socialism is on democracy capitalism leads to economic democracy socialism leads to the economic dictatorship of the elite always and everywhere so beware would you ask for you just might get it.</p>
