# Introduction

The aim of this book is to provide an understanding of how to analyse and assess the performance and financial position of a company from the various sources of information available.

Profit and finance are the two broad strands interwoven in the overall management of successful business organizations today. Profit is not sufficient on its own; a company must have the resources to allow it to continue in business and to flourish. Without profit there can be no dividend or share value improvements, or reinvestment for future growth and development. A substantial part of this book focuses on various ways of identifying and measuring profitability.

An important lesson from the downturn in the 1990s and the 2008 global financial crisis is to invest in a company only when you are absolutely certain you understand the business and sector within which it operates. If you cannot see where the profit are coming from, don't invest. If you cannot understand what the company does, don't invest.
