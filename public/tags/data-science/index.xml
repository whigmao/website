      <description>Unit 2: Random Variables, Parametric Models, and Inference from Observation  Random Variable and Distribution Functions A random variable is a function from the sample space Ω to a set of outcomes.
 Cumulative distribution function (cdf) - Value of cdf at \(x\) is probability that the random variable is less than or equal to \(x\).
 Probability mass function (pmf) - Maps each possible value of a discrete random variable to its probability</description>

      <description>Unit 3: Bayesian Inference with Conjugate Pairs: Single Parameter Models  Canonical Statistical Inference Problem Given: data set of \(N\) observations \(X_1, …, X_N\)
 Assume: \(X_i\) are a random (iid) sample from a probability distribution with unknown parameters.
   \(X_i\) and paremeters can be univariate or multivariate
 Set of possible values for \(X\) and/or parameters can be finite, discrete infinite, or continuous
 This unit considers univariate, continuous parameters</description>

      <title>Book Review: R for Data Science</title>
      <link>/2020/01/02/book-review-r-for-data-science/</link>

      <description>After reading the book: R for Data Science, I plan to write a book review to summary some important skills I learned from the book and shed new light on the future study direction. The book helps me understand the whole diagram about data science, and what role R plays in the diagram. However, the book is not a definitive guide. These are a lot of important topics, such as TensorFlow, model building and non-rectangular data, not appearing in the book.</description>
