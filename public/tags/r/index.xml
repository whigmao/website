      <description>After reading the book: R for Data Science, I plan to write a book review to summary some important skills I learned from the book and shed new light on the future study direction. The book helps me understand the whole diagram about data science, and what role R plays in the diagram. However, the book is not a definitive guide. These are a lot of important topics, such as TensorFlow, model building and non-rectangular data, not appearing in the book.</description>
