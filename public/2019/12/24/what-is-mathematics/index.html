<h1>什么是数学</h1>
<p>Mathematics as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will, the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection. Its basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and construction, generality and individuality. Though different traditions may emphasize different aspects, it is only the interplay of these antithetic forces and the struggle for their synthesis that constitute the life, usefulness, and supreme value of mathematical science.</p>
<p>作为人类思想的一种表达，数学体现着活跃的思想，沉思的原因，以及对完美美学的渴望。数学的基本元素是逻辑和直觉，分析与构建，通用性兼个体性。尽管不同的传统会强调不同的方面，但正是这些对立力量的相互作用以及它们的综合斗争，才构成了数学科学的生命，有用性和最高价值。</p>
<p>Without a doubt, all mathematical development has its psychological roots in more or less practical requirements. But once started under the pressure of necessary applications, it inevitably gains momentum in itself and transcends the confines of immediate utility. This trend from applied to theoretical science appears in ancient history as well as in many contributions to modern mathematics by engineers and physicists.</p>
<p>毫无疑问， 所有的数学发展都或多或少地根植于实践的需要。但一旦在急需应用的压力下开始启动，它便不可避免地拥有了自我驱动力，并超越了立即效用的范围。从应用科学到理论科学的这一趋势即出现在古代，同时也体现在工程师和物理学家对现代数学的贡献上。</p>
<p>Recorded mathematics begins in the Orient, where, about 2000 B.C., the Babylonians collected a great wealth of material that we would classify today under elementary algebra. Yet as a science in the modern sense mathematics only emerges later, on Greek soil, in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. The ever-increasing contact between the Orient and the Greeks, beginning at the time of the Persian empire and reaching a climax in the period following Alexander’s expeditions, made the Greeks familiar with the achievements of Babylonian mathematics and astronomy. Mathematics was soon subjected to the philosophical discussion that flourished in the Greek city states. Thus Greek thinkers became conscious of the great difficulties inherent in the mathematical concepts of continuity, motion, and infinity, and in the problem of measuring arbitrary quantities by given units. In an admirable effort the challenge was met, and the result, Eudoxus’ theory of the geometrical continuum, is an achievement that was only paralleled more than two thousand years later by the modern theory of irrational numbers. The deductive-postulational trend in mathematics originated at the time of Eudoxus and was crystallized in Euclid’s <em>Elements</em>.</p>
<p>有记录的数学出现在大学公元前2000年的东方某处， 巴比伦人收集了大量的，我们现在称之为初等代数的材料。然而作为一门现代意义上的数学科学之后才诞生在公元4世纪和5世纪的希腊。东方与希腊人之间的联系，始于波斯帝国时期，并在亚历山大远征之后达到高潮，日益密切的沟通使希腊人熟悉巴比伦数学和天文学的成就。数学也很快收到了在希腊城邦中兴旺发达的哲学讨论的影响。因此，希腊思想家意识到连续性，运动性和无限性的数学概念，以及以给定单位测量任意量的问题所固有的巨大困难。经过令人敬仰的奋斗，挑战得到了解决，其结果— Eudoxus 的几何连续体理论是一项伟大的成就，两千多年后的现代无理数论中才能与之相提并论。数学的演绎-假设趋势起源于 Eudoxus 时代，并在欧几里得的《元素》中得以体现。</p>
<p>However, while the theoretical and postulational tendency of Greek mathematics remains one of its important characteristics and has exercised an enormous influence, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that application and connection with physical reality played just as important a part in the mathematics of antiquity, and that a manner of presentation less rigid than Euclid’s was very often preferred.</p>
<p>然而，尽管希腊数学的理论和假设趋势是其重要特征，并已产生了巨大影响，但不能过分强调，应用和与物理现实的联系在古代数学中也起着重要作用，而且其比欧几里得的僵硬程度更低的表现形式通常更受欢迎。</p>
<p>It may be that the early discovery of the difficulties connected with “incommensurable” quantities deterred the Greeks from developing the art of numerical reckoning achieved before in the Orient. Instead, they forced their way through the thicket of pure axiomatic geometry, Thus one of the strange detours of the history of science began, and perhaps a great opportunity was missed. For almost two thousand years the weight of Greek geometrical tradition retarded the inevitable evolution of the number concept and of algebraic manipulation, which later formed the basis of modern science.</p>
<p>可能是由于早期发现与“不可估量”数量有关的困难，使希腊人无法发展以前在东方获得的数字计算技术。取而代之的是，他们强迫自己走过纯公理几何学的丛林，从而开始了科学史上奇怪的绕道之一，也许错过了一个巨大的机会。在将近2000年的时间里，希腊几何传统的重要性阻碍了数字概念和代数运算的不可避免的演变，而后者后来成为现代科学的基础。</p>
<p>After a period of slow preparation, the revolution in mathematics and science began its vigorous phase in the seventeenth century with analytic geometry and the differential and integral calculus. While Greek geometry retained an important place, the Greek ideal of axiomatic crystallization and systematic deduction disappeared in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Logically precise reasoning, starting from clear definitions and noncontradictory, “evident” axioms, seemed immaterial to the new pioneers of mathematical science. In a veritable orgy of intuitive guesswork, of cogent reasoning interwoven with nonsensical mysticism, with blind confidence in the superhuman power of formal procedure, they conquered a mathematical world of immense riches. Gradually the ecstasy of progress gave way to a spirit of critical self- control. In the nineteenth century, the immanent need for consolidation and the desire for more security in the extension of higher learning that was prompted by the French revolution, inevitably led back to a revision of the foundations of the new mathematics, in particular of the differential and integral calculus and the underlying concept of limit. Thus the nineteenth century not only became a period of new advances, but was also characterized by a successful return to the classical ideal of precision and rigorous proof. In this respect, it even surpassed the model of Greek science. Once more the pendulum swung toward the side of logical purity and abstraction. At present we still seem to be in this period, although it is to be hoped that the resulting unfortunate separation between pure mathematics and the vital applications, perhaps inevitable in times of critical revision, will be followed by an era of closer unity. The regained internal strength and, above all, the enormous simplification attained based on clearer comprehension make it possible today to master the mathematical theory without losing sight of applications. To establish once again an organic union between pure and applied science and a sound balance between abstract generality and colorful individuality may well be the paramount task of mathematics in the immediate future.</p>
<p>经过了漫长的准备，数学和科学革命在17世纪开始蓬勃发展，其中包括解析几何以及微分和积分学。尽管希腊的几何学仍然占有重要地位，但公理化和系统演绎的希腊理想在17世纪和18世纪消失了。发轫于明确的定义和无矛盾的“显而易见的”公理的，精确的逻辑推理对于数学科学的新开拓者似乎并不重要。在一场真正的直觉猜测，狂欢式推理与无意义的神秘主义交织在一起的真正狂欢中，他们对正式程序的超人力量充满了盲目的信心，他们征服了巨大财富的数学世界。渐渐地，狂喜变成了批判性的自我控制精神。在19世纪，由于法国大革命的推动，对合并的迫切需求和对更高安全性的渴望，不可避免地导致了对新数学基础的修改，特别是对微分和数学的修改。积分学和极限的基本概念。因此，十九世纪不仅成为一个新的发展时期，而且其特征还在于成功地回归到精确和严格证明的经典理想。在这方面，它甚至超越了希腊科学的模式。钟摆再一次转向逻辑纯净和抽象的一面。目前，我们似乎仍处在这个时期，尽管希望纯数学和重要应用之间不幸的分离（在批判性修订时可能不可避免）将跟随一个更加团结的时代。重新获得的内部力量以及最重要的是，基于更清晰的理解获得了极大的简化，从而使今天有可能掌握数学理论而不会遗漏应用程序。在不久的将来，再次建立纯科学与应用科学之间的有机结合以及抽象一般性与多彩个性之间的合理平衡很可能是数学的首要任务。</p>
<p>This is not the place for a detailed philosophical or psychological analysis of mathematics. Only a few points should be stressed. There seems to be a great danger in the prevailing overemphasis on the deductive-postulational character of mathematics. True, the element of the constructive invention, of directing and motivating intuition, is apt to elude a simple philosophical formulation; but it remains the core of any mathematical achievement, even in the most abstract fields. If the crystallized deductive form is the goal, intuition and construction are at least the driving forces. A serious threat to the very life of science is implied in the assertion that mathematics is nothing but a system of conclusions drawn from definitions and postulates that must be consistent but otherwise may be created by the free will of the mathematician. If this description were accurate, mathematics could not attract any intelligent person. It would be a game with definitions, rules, and syllogisms without motive or goal. The notion that the intellect can create meaningful postulational systems at its whim is a deceptive half-truth. Only under the discipline of responsibility to the organic whole, only guided by intrinsic necessity, can the free mind achieve results of scientific value.</p>
<p>这并不会讨论细枝末节的哲学与精神的数学分析。仅有一些要点应该被提及。盛行过分强调数学的演绎-假设特性似乎是一个巨大的危机。的确，构建发明的，指引并驱动直觉的元素是易于避免简单的哲学公式，但它仍然是数学成就的核心，即使是在最抽象的领域。如果公理化的演绎形式是目的，直觉和构建至少也是驱动力。断言数学只不过是从定义和假设中得出的结论体系，它必须是一致的，否则可能是由数学家的自由意志创造的，这对科学的生命构成了严重威胁。如果这个描述是正确的，那么数学就不会吸引任何聪明的人。 这将是一个没有定义，规则和三段论的游戏，没有动机或目标。 智力可以一时兴起地创建有意义的假定系统的观点是一种欺骗性的半真相。 自由思想只有在对内在整体负责的纪律下，只有在内在的必要性的指导下，才能取得科学价值的结果。</p>
<p>While the contemplative trend of logical analysis does not represent all of mathematics, it has led to a more profound understanding of mathematical facts and their interdependence, and a clearer comprehension of the essence of mathematical concepts. From it has evolved a modern point of view in mathematics that is typical of a universal scientific attitude.</p>
<p>尽管逻辑分析的当代趋势不能代表全部的数学，但它已导致对数学事实及其相互依存关系有了更深刻的理解，并且对数学概念的本质有了更清晰的理解。 由此发展出一种现代的数学观点，这是普遍科学态度的典型代表。</p>
<p>Whatever our philosophical standpoint may be, for all purposes of scientific observation an object exhausts itself in the totality of possible relations to the perceiving subject or instrument. Of course, mere perception does not constitute knowledge and insight; it must be coordinated and interpreted by reference to some underlying entity, a“thing in itself,” which is not an object of direct physical observation, but belongs to metaphysics. Yet for the scientific procedure, it is important to discard elements of metaphysical character and to consider observable facts always as the ultimate source of notions and constructions. To renounce the goal of comprehending the“thing in itself,” of knowing the“ultimate truth,” of unraveling the innermost essence of the world, may be a psychological hardship for naive enthusiasts, but in fact, it was one of the most fruitful turns in modern thinking.</p>
<p>无论我们的哲学观点是什么，出于科学观察的所有目的，一个对象都会在与感知对象或工具的可能关系的全部中耗尽自身。 当然，单纯的感知并不构成知识和见识。 它必须通过参考某些基础实体（本身就是事物）进行协调和解释，这不是直接物理观察的对象，而是属于形而上学。 然而，对于科学程序而言，重要的是丢弃形而上学特征的要素，并始终将可观察的事实视为概念和建构的最终来源。 放弃理解“本身的东西”，了解“最终真理”，揭示世界最内在本质的目标，对于天真的爱好者可能是心理上的困难，但实际上，这是最富有成果的人之一 转变为现代思维。</p>
<p>Some of the greatest achievements in physics have come as a reward for courageous adherence to the principle of eliminating metaphysics. When Einstein tried to reduce the notion of“simultaneous events occurring at different places” to observable phenomena, when he unmasked as a metaphysical prejudice the belief that this concept must have a scientific meaning in itself, he had found the key to his theory of relativity. When Niels Bohr and his pupils analyzed the fact that any physical observation must be accompanied by an effect of the observing instrument on the observed object, it became clear that the sharp simultaneous fixation of position and velocity of a particle is not possible in the sense of physics. The far-reaching consequences of this discovery, embodied in the modem theory of quantum mechanics, are now familiar to every physicist. In the nineteenth century, the idea prevailed that mechanical forces and motions of particles in space are things in themselves, while electricity, light, and magnetism should be reduced to or explained as mechanical phenomena, just as had been done with heat. The“ether” was invented as a hypothetical medium capable of not entirely explained mechanical motions that appear to us as light or electricity. Slowly it was realized that the ether is of necessity unobservable; that it belongs to metaphysics and not to physics. With sorrow in some quarters, with relief in others, the mechanical explanations of light and electricity, and with them the ether, were finally abandoned.</p>
<p>物理学上一些伟大的成就是对勇敢坚持消除形而上学原理的奖励。当爱因斯坦试图将“在不同地方发生的同时发生的事件”的概念简化为可观察到的现象时，当他揭露作为一种形而上学的偏见而认为这种概念本身必须具有科学意义时，他就找到了相对论的关键。 。当尼尔斯·玻尔（Niels Bohr）和他的学生分析了这样一个事实，即任何物理观察都必须伴随有观察仪器对被观察物体的影响，很明显，就粒子的位置和速度而言，不可能同时强烈地固定其位置和速度。物理。现在，每个物理学家都熟悉这一发现的深远影响，体现在现代量子力学理论中。在19世纪，这种观点盛行，即机械力和粒子在空间中的运动本身就是事物，而电，光和磁应像加热一样减少或解释为机械现象。发明“醚”是一种假设介质，它不能完全解释对我们来说似乎是光或电的机械运动。慢慢地，人们意识到以太必然是不可观察的。它属于形而上学，而不是物理学。由于有些地方感到悲伤，而另一些地方感到轻松，最终放弃了对光和电的机械解释以及与之相关的以太。</p>
<p>A similar situation, even more accentuated, exists in mathematics. Throughout the ages mathematicians have considered their objects, such as numbers, points, etc., as substantial things in themselves. Since these entities had always defied attempts at an adequate description, it slowly dawned on the mathematicians of the nineteenth century that the question of the meaning of these objects as substantial things does not make sense within mathematics, if at all. The only relevant assertions concerning them do not refer to substantial reality; they state only the interrelations between mathematically“undefined objects” and the rules governing operations with them. What points, lines, numbers&quot; actually&quot; <em>are</em> cannot and need not be discussed in mathematical science. What matters and what corresponds to“verifiable” fact is structure and relationship, that two points determine a line, that numbers combine according to certain rules to form other numbers, etc. A clear insight into the necessity of a dis substantiation of elementary mathematical concepts have been one of the most important and fruitful results of modern postulational development.</p>
<p>数学中也存在类似的情况，甚至更加突出。长期以来，数学家一直将其对象（例如数字，点等）视为自身的重要事物。由于这些实体一直不肯尝试进行适当的描述，因此在十九世纪的数学家中慢慢意识到，这些对象作为实质性事物的意义问题在数学中根本没有意义。关于它们的唯一相关断言并不涉及实质性现实。它们仅陈述了数学上“未定义的对象”与控制它们之间的操作的规则之间的关系。数学科学中不能也不需要讨论“实际上” 是什么的点，线，数。重要和与“可验证的”事实相对应的是结构和关系，两点确定一条线，数字根据某些规则组合以形成其他数字，等等。是现代假定发展最重要，最富有成果的成果之一。</p>
<p>Fortunately, creative minds forget dogmatic philosophical beliefs whenever adherence to them would impede constructive achievement. For scholars and layman alike it is not philosophy but active experience in mathematics itself that alone can answer the question: What is mathematics?</p>
<p>幸运的是，每当坚持有创意的思想阻碍建设性成就时，他们就会忘记教条式的哲学信念。 对于学者和非专业人士而言，不是哲学而是数学本身的积极经验就能独自回答以下问题：什么是数学？</p>
