A few month ago, I wrote some articles about economics which provided some essential tools to analyze how people made decisions, how people interacted with each other and how market ran as a whole. The tools can help us understand why free market is the best way to allocate scarce resources, why capitalism works, and what are equilibrium and marginal utilities. However, for individuals, if we want to analyze a company or create a company to earn money. Economics cannot provide enough tools.
