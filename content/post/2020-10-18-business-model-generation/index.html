<p>A few month ago, I wrote some articles about economics which provided some essential tools to analyze how people made decisions, how people interacted with each other and how market ran as a whole. The tools can help us understand why free market is the best way to allocate scarce resources, why capitalism works, and what are equilibrium and marginal utilities. However, for individuals, if we want to analyze a company or create a company to earn money. Economics cannot provide enough tools.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7723797-business-model-generation">Business Model Generation</a></em> provides a lot of useful tools to analyze companies and how to create your business. In this article, I am going to introduce these tools.</p>

<h2>Business Model</h2>

<p>A business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value</p>

<p>Business model is composed of <strong>nine basic building blocks</strong> that show the logic of how a company intends to make money. The nine blocks cover the four main areas of a business: customers, offer, infrastructure, and financial viability. The business model is like a blueprint for a strategy to be implemented through organizational structures, processes, and systems.</p>

<h2>Un-Bundling Business Models</h2>
<p>The concept of the “unbundled” corporation holds that there are three fundamentally different types of businesses: Customer Relationship businesses, product innovation businesses, and infrastructure businesses. Each type has different economic, competitive, and cultural imperatives. The three types may co-exist within a single corporation, but ideally they are “unbundled” into separate entities in order to avoid conflicts or undesirable trade-offs.</p>

<div id="the-long-tail" class="section level2">
<h2>The Long Tail</h2>
<p>long tail business models are about selling less of more: They focus on offering a large number of niche products, each of which sells relatively infrequently. Aggregate sales of niche items can be as lucrative as the traditional model whereby a small number of bestsellers account for most revenues. Long Tail business models require low inventory costs and strong platforms to make niche content readily available to interested buyers.</p>

<div id="multi-sided-platforms" class="section level2">
<h2>Multi-Sided Platforms</h2>
<p>Multi-sided platforms bring together two or more distinct but interdependent groups of customers. • Such platforms are of value to one group of customers only if the other groups of customers are also present. The platform creates value by facilitating interactions between the different groups. A multi-sided platform grows in value to the extent that it attracts more users, a phenomenon known as the network effect.</p>

<h2>FREE as a Business Model</h2>
<p>In the free business model at least one substantial Customer Segment is able to continuously benefit from a free-of-charge offer. Different patterns make the free offer possible. Non-paying customers are financed by another part of the business model or by another Customer Segment.</p>
