<div id="externalities" class="section level1">
<h1>Externalities</h1>
<p>When a transaction between a buyer and seller directly affects a third party, the effect is called an <strong>externality</strong>. If an activity yields negative externalities, such as pollution, the socially optimal quantity in a market is less than the equilibrium quantity. If an activity yields positive externalities, such as technology spillovers, the socially optimal quantity is greater than the equilibrium quantity.</p>
<p>Governments pursue various policies to remedy the inefficiencies caused by externalities. Sometimes the government prevents socially inefficient activity by regulating behavior. Other times it internalizes an externality using corrective taxes. Another public policy is to issue permits. For example, the government could protect the environment by issuing a limited number of pollution permits. The result of this policy is similar to imposing corrective taxes on polluters.</p>
<p>Those affected by externalities can sometimes solve the problem privately. For instance, when one business imposes an externality on another business, the two businesses can internalize the externality by merging. Alternatively, the interested parties can solve the problem by negotiating a contract. According to the Coase theorem, if people can bargain without cost, then they can always reach an agreement in which resources are allocated efficiently. In many cases, however, reaching a bargain among the many interested parties is difficult, so the Coase theorem does not apply.</p>
<p><strong>What makes me confused is whether every transaction contains externalities. In addition, should government subsidies positive externalities, such as Wikipedia? How much should government support these activities? Do current government subsidies result in positive outcomes?</strong></p>

<h1>Public Goods and Common Resources</h1>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">four types of goods</p>
</div>
<p>Goods differ in whether they are excludable and whether they are rival in consumption. A good is excludable if it is possible to prevent someone from using it. A good is rival in consumption if one person’s use of the good reduces others’ ability to use the same unit of the good. Markets work best for private goods, which are both excludable and rival in consumption. Markets do not work as well for other types of goods.</p>
<div id="public-goods" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Public Goods</h2>
<p>Public goods are neither rival in consumption nor excludable. Examples of public goods include fireworks displays, national defense, and the discovery of fundamental knowledge. Because people are not charged for their use of the public good, they have an incentive to free ride, making private provision of the good untenable. Therefore, governments provide public goods, basing their decision about the quantity of each good on cost–benefit analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="common-resources" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Common Resources</h2>
<p>Common resources are rival in consumption but not excludable. Examples include common grazing land, clean air, and congested roads. Because people are not charged for their use of common resources, they tend to use them excessively, which is an definitive example of Tragedy of the Commons. Therefore, governments use various methods, such as regulations and corrective taxes, to limit the use of common resources.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-importance-of-property-rights" class="section level2">
<h2>3. The Importance of Property Rights</h2>
<p>In this and the previous articles, we have seen there are some “goods” that the market does not provide adequately. Markets do not ensure that the air we breathe is clean or that our country is defended from foreign aggressors. Instead, societies rely on the government to protect the environment and to provide for the national defense.</p>
<p>The problems we considered in these chapters arise in many different markets, but they share a common theme. In all cases, the market fails to allocate resources efficiently because property rights are not well established. That is, some item of value does not have an owner with the legal authority to control it. For example, although no one doubts that the “good” of clean air or national defense is valuable, no one has the right to attach a price to it and profit from its use. A factory pollutes too much because no one charges the factory for the pollution it emits. The market does not provide for national defense because no one can charge those who are defended for the benefit they receive.</p>
<p>When the absence of property rights causes a market failure, the government can potentially solve the problem. Sometimes, as in the sale of pollution permits, the solution is for the government to help define property rights and thereby unleash market forces. Other times, as in restricted hunting seasons, the solution is for the government to regulate private behavior. Still other times, as in the provision of national defense, the solution is for the government to use tax revenue to supply a good that the market fails to supply. In each of these cases, if the policy is well planned and well run, it can make the allocation of resources more efficient and thus raise economic well-being.</p>

<div id="the-design-of-the-tax-system" class="section level1">
<h1>The Design of the Tax System</h1>
<p>The U.S. government raises revenue using various taxes. The most important taxes for the federal government are personal income taxes and payroll taxes for social insurance. The most important taxes for state and local governments are sales taxes and property taxes.</p>
<p>The efficiency of a tax system refers to the costs it imposes on taxpayers. There are two costs of taxes beyond the transfer of resources from the taxpayer to the government. The first is the deadweight loss that arises as taxes alter incentives and distort the allocation of resources. The second is the administrative burden of complying with the tax laws.</p>
<p>The equity of a tax system concerns whether the tax burden is distributed fairly among the population. According to the benefits principle, it is fair for people to pay taxes based on the benefits they receive from the government. According to the ability-to-pay principle, it is fair for people to pay taxes based on their capability to handle the financial burden. When evaluating the equity of a tax system, it is important to remember a lesson from the study of tax incidence: The distribution of tax burdens is not the same as the distribution of tax bills.</p>
<p>When considering changes in the tax laws, policymakers often face a trade-off between efficiency and equity. Much of the debate over tax policy arises because people give different weights to these two goals.</p>
<p><strong>My question is what is efficience and equty on earth? What should the society care about equity? What is the responsibility of government? If property rights need to be respected, how can government impose tax to achieve their so called equity?</strong></p>
