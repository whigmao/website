<h1>1. Database System</h1>
<p>Good decisions require good information derived from raw facts. Users can manage data efficiently when it is stored in database in term of size, security, accuracy, ease of updating and redundance.</p>
<p>Databases are shared, integrated computer structure that stores a collection of data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>End-user data: raw facts of interest to the end user</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata: data about data, description of data characteristics and relationships in data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Database management systems (DBMS) are collection of programs that manage the structure and control access to data. DBMS is the intermediary between the user and the database.</p>
<p>Database system: defines and regulates the collection, storage, management, use of data. There are five major parts of a database system:Hardware, Software, People, Procedures and Data.</p>

<h1>2. Data Models</h1>
<p>Data models are relatively simple representations of complex real-world data structures (often graphical).</p>
<p>Entity, attribute, relationship and constraint are data model basic building blocks.</p>
<p>Business rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Represent detailed description of policies, procedures, or principles within a specific organization</p></li>
<li><p>Describe characteristics of data as viewed by the company</p></li>
<li><p>Allow the designer to understand business processes and the nature, role, and scope of the data</p></li>
<li><p>Help the designer to develop appropriate entities, relationship participation rules and constraints</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When designer transform business rules into data model components, generally, nouns will translate into entities and verbs will translate into relationships among the entities.</p>
<p>The hierarchical model is the first data model.</p>
<p>The relational data model is implemented through a very sophisticated software called relational database management system.</p>
<p>For most RDBMS, the query language is Structured Query Language (<strong>SQL</strong>) which make it possible to retrieve data with far less efforts than any other database environment.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Data Definition Language (DDL):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Used by the DBA and database designers to specify the conceptual schema of a database.</p></li>
<li><p>In many DBMSs, the DDL is also used to define internal and external schemas (views).</p></li>
<li><p>In some DBMSs, separate storage definition language (SDL) and view definition language (VDL) are used to define internal and external schemas.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Data Manipulation Language (DML):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Used to specify database retrievals and updates</p></li>
<li><p>DML commands (data sublanguage) can be embedded in a general-purpose programming language (host language), such as COBOL, C, C++, or Java.</p>
<ul>
<li>A library of functions can also be provided to access the DBMS from a programming language</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, stand-alone DML commands can be applied directly (called a query language).</p></li>

<h1>4. Data Modeling Using the ER Model</h1>
<div id="er-model-concepts" class="section level2">
<h2>4.1 ER Model Concepts</h2>
<p>Entity is a basic concept for the ER model. Entities are specific things or objects in the mini-world that are represented in the database.</p>
<p>Attributes are properties used to describe an entity. There are three types of attributes: simple, composite and multi-valued.</p>
<p>A specific entity will have a value for each of its attributes.</p>
<p>Constraints on Relationship Types (Also known as ratio constraints)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cardinality Ratio (specifies maximum participation)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One-to-one (1:1)</p></li>
<li><p>One-to-many (1:N) or Many-to-one (N:1)</p></li>
<li><p>Many-to-many (M:N)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Existence Dependency Constraint (specifies minimum participation) (also called participation constraint)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>zero (optional participation, not existence-dependent)</p></li>
<li><p>one or more (mandatory participation, existence-dependent)</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Recursive relationship: both participations are same entity type in different roles.</p>

<h2>4.2 EER Model Concepts</h2>
<p>EER Model Concepts includes all modeling concepts of basic ER.</p>
<p>Additional concept are subclasses/superclasses, specialization/generalization, categories (UNION types), attribute and relationship inheritance and constraints on Specialization/Generalization.</p>
