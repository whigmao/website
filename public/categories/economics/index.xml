      <description>China’s economy is 12% smaller than official data say, study finds
 Beijing statisticians ‘do not have capacity’ to correct inflated local figures
 China’s economy is about 12 per cent smaller than official figures indicate, and its real growth has been overstated by about 2 percentage points annually in recent years, according to research.
The findings in the paper published on Thursday by the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank, reinforced longstanding scepticism about Chinese official statistics.</description>

      <description>The Markets for the Factors of Production The economy’s income is distributed in the markets for the factors of production. The three most important factors of production are labor, land, and capital.
The demand for factors, such as labor, is a derived demand that comes from firms that use the factors to produce goods and services. Competitive, profitmaximizing firms hire each factor up to the point at which the value of the factor’s marginal product equals its price.</description>

      <description>Consumer Choice A consumer’s budget constraint shows the possible combinations of different goods she can buy given her income and the prices of the goods. The slope of the budget constraint equals the relative price of the goods.
The consumer’s indifference curves represent her preferences. An indifference curve shows the various bundles of goods that make the consumer equally happy. Points on higher indifference curves are preferred to points on lower indifference curves.</description>

      <description>The Market Forces of Supply and Demand Economists use the model of supply and demand to analyze competitive markets. In a competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers, each of whom has little or no influence on the market price.
1. The Demand Curve The demand curve shows how the quantity of a good demanded depends on the price. According to the law of demand, as the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded rises.</description>

      <description>Consumers, Producers, and the Efficiency of Markets 1. Consumer Surplus Consumer surplus equals buyers’ willingness to pay for a good minus the amount they actually pay, and it measures the benefit buyers get from participating in a market. Consumer surplus can be computed by finding the area below the demand curve and above the price.
 2. Producer Surplus Producer surplus equals the amount sellers receive for their goods minus their costs of production, and it measures the benefit sellers get from participating in a market.</description>

      <description>Externalities When a transaction between a buyer and seller directly affects a third party, the effect is called an externality. If an activity yields negative externalities, such as pollution, the socially optimal quantity in a market is less than the equilibrium quantity. If an activity yields positive externalities, such as technology spillovers, the socially optimal quantity is greater than the equilibrium quantity.
Governments pursue various policies to remedy the inefficiencies caused by externalities.</description>

      <description>The Costs of Production The goal of firms is to maximize profit, which equals total revenue minus total cost.
When analyzing a firm’s behavior, it is important to include all the opportunity costs of production. Some of the opportunity costs, such as the wages a firm pays its workers, are explicit. Other opportunity costs, such as the wages the firm owner gives up by working at the firm rather than taking another job, are implicit.</description>

      <description>When I started learning economics, I thought economics can teach me to make more money because the word ‘economics’ implied money in my first look. Undoubtablely, my thought is wrong. Therefore, when I decide to write the introduction article, I need to illustrate what is economics indeed.
Accrording to The Principle of Economics by Gregory Mankiw. Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources. Economists study how people make decisions.</description>
